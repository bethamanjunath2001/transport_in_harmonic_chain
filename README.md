# transport_in_harmonic_chain
This project is carried out at ICTS Bengaluru under the guidance of Dr Anupam Kundu. The project focuses on heat transport in 1D classical harmonic chain. The Quantity of interest is the energy that passes through a bond in the chain in a given time period 't' from any initial condition (position vector and velocity vector of each particle in chain). To get this I had to write out a lot of reusable functions and a few data structures on which the whole framework depends on. For instance I have written a full package of functions and header file that does simple matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, dot product, etc. This repository contains all such organised code from the code.
